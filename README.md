This is the training data accompanying the paper 
"Tree Neural Network in HOL4".

The sub-folder "datasets" contains three files:
- train for the training set
- valid for the validation set
- test for the test set
Each line of these files consists of an arithmetical expression 
in S-expression format and its evaluation. The third number is irrelevant.

Explain how to run the experiments.
