This is the training data accompanying the paper 
"Tree Neural Network in HOL4".

The sub-folder `data_arith` contains three files:
    train for the training set
    valid for the validation set
    test for the test set

This files contain arithmetical expressions followed on the next line
by their value.

Copy the directory `data_arith` to `HOL/examples/AI_TNN/data_arith` to be
able to replicate the arithmetical evaluation experiment.

##Remark: 
The directory `arith_data_lopl` contains additionnally in the 
third field the derivation length of left-outermost startegy using robinson 
arithmetic rewrite rules which was used in a previous unpublished experiement.
