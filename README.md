These are the datasets accompanying the paper 
"Tree Neural Network in HOL4".

## Datasets

The sub-folder `data_arith` contains three files:
* train for the training set
* valid for the validation set
* test for the test set

These files contain arithmetical expressions followed on the next line
by their value.

## Remark: 
The directory `arith_data_lopl` contains additionnally in the 
third field the derivation length of left-outermost startegy using robinson 
arithmetic rewrite rules which was used in a previous unpublished experiement.
